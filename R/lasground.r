#' Classify points as ground or not ground
#'
#' Implements algorithms for segmentation of ground points. The function updates the field
#' \code{Classification} of the input LAS object. The points classified as 'ground' are
#' assigned a value of 2 according to las specifications (See the ASPRS documentation for the
#' \href{http://www.asprs.org/a/society/committees/standards/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf}{LAS file format}).
#'
#' @param las a LAS object
#' @param algorithm character. The name of an algorithm. Currently \code{"pmf"} is supported
#' (see related sections)
#' @param ... Parameter for each avaible algorithm
#' @param min_ws numeric. Minimum windows size to be used in filtering ground returns.
#' This is the parameter \code{b} in Zhang et al. (2003) (see references)
#' @param max_ws numeric. Maximum window size to be used in filtering ground returns in
#' Zhang et al. (2003)
#' @param min_th numeric. Initial threshold height above the parameterized ground surface
#' to be considered a ground return. This is \code{dt0} in Zhang et al. (2003)
#' @param max_th numeric. Maximum threshold height above the parameterized ground surface
#' to be considered a ground return. This is \code{dhmax} in Zhang et al. (2003)
#' @param s  numeric. Slope value to be used in computing the height thresholds sequence.
#'  This is the parameter \code{s} in Zhang et al. (2003)
#'
#' @section Progressive morphological filter (PMF):
#'
#' This method is an implementation of the Zhang et al. (2003) algorithm (see reference).
#' This is not a strict implementation of Zhang et al. This algorithm works at the raw point
#' cloud level without any rasterization process. Therefore some parameter from the original
#' description are no longer useful. The cell size \code{c} is not a requiered parameter.
#' Therefore in the original paper the threshold sequence was:\cr\cr
#' \eqn{th_k = s*(w_k - w_{k-1})*c + th_0}\cr\cr
#' Now it is:\cr\cr
#' \eqn{th_k = s*(w_k - w_{k-1}) + th_0}\cr\cr
#' This method support an extra logical parameters \code{exponential} to change the method
#' used to create the windows size sequence. Default is FALSE. See reference.
#'
#' @return Nothing. The original LAS object is updated by reference. In the 'Classification'
#' column a value of 2 denotes ground according to LAS specifications.
