\usage{
lasground(las, algorithm, ...)

lasground_pmf(las, min_ws = 2, max_ws = 20, min_th = 0.5, max_th = 3,
  slope = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{a LAS object}

\item{algorithm}{character. The name of an algorithm. Currently \code{"pmf"} is supported
(see related sections)}

\item{...}{Parameter for each avaible algorithm}

\item{min_ws}{numeric. Minimum windows size to be used in filtering ground returns.
This is the parameter \code{b} in Zhang et al. (2003) (see references)}

\item{max_ws}{numeric. Maximum window size to be used in filtering ground returns in
Zhang et al. (2003)}

\item{min_th}{numeric. Initial threshold height above the parameterized ground surface
to be considered a ground return. This is \code{dt0} in Zhang et al. (2003)}

\item{max_th}{numeric. Maximum threshold height above the parameterized ground surface
to be considered a ground return. This is \code{dhmax} in Zhang et al. (2003)}

\item{slope}{numeric. Slope value to be used in computing the height thresholds sequence.
This is the parameter \code{s} in Zhang et al. (2003)}
}
\value{
Nothing. The original LAS object is updated by reference. In the 'Classification'
column a value of 2 denotes ground according to LAS specifications.
}
\description{
Implements algorithms for segmentation of ground points. The function updates the field
\code{Classification} of the input LAS object. The points classified as 'ground' are
assigned a value of 2 according to las specifications (See the ASPRS documentation for the
\href{http://www.asprs.org/a/society/committees/standards/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf}{LAS file format}).

\section{Progressive morphological filter (PMF)}{


This method is an implementation of the Zhang et al. (2003) algorithm (see reference).
This is not a strict implementation of Zhang et al. This algorithm works at the raw point
cloud level without any rasterization process. Therefore some parameter from the original
description are no longer useful. The celle size \code{c} is not a requiered parameter.
Therefore in the original paper the threshold sequence was:\cr\cr
\eqn{th_k = s*(w_k - w_{k-1})*c +th_0}\cr\cr
Now it is:\cr\cr
\eqn{th_k = s*(w_k - w_{k-1}) +th_0}\cr\cr
This method support an extra logical parameters \code{exponential} to change the method
used to create the windows size sequence.. Defauult is FALSE
See reference.
