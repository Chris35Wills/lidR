\usage{
lasground(las, algorithm, ...)

lasground_pmf(las, min_ws = 2, max_ws = 20, min_th = 0.5, max_th = 3,
  s = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{a LAS object}

\item{algorithm}{character. The name of an algorithm. Currently \code{"pmf"} is supported
(see related sections)}

\item{...}{Parameter for each avaible algorithm}

\item{min_ws}{numeric. Minimum windows size to be used in filtering ground returns.
This is the parameter \code{b} in Zhang et al. (2003) (see references)}

\item{max_ws}{numeric. Maximum window size to be used in filtering ground returns in
Zhang et al. (2003)}

\item{min_th}{numeric. Initial threshold height above the parameterized ground surface
to be considered a ground return. This is \code{dt0} in Zhang et al. (2003)}

\item{max_th}{numeric. Maximum threshold height above the parameterized ground surface
to be considered a ground return. This is \code{dhmax} in Zhang et al. (2003)}

\item{s}{numeric. Slope value to be used in computing the height thresholds sequence.
This is the parameter \code{s} in Zhang et al. (2003) (equation 7)}
}
\value{
Nothing. The original LAS object is updated by reference. In the 'Classification'
column a value of 2 denotes ground according to LAS specifications.
}
\description{
Implements algorithms for segmentation of ground points. The function updates the field
\code{Classification} of the input LAS object. The points classified as 'ground' are
assigned a value of 2 according to las specifications (See the ASPRS documentation for the
\href{http://www.asprs.org/a/society/committees/standards/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf}{LAS file format}).

\section{Progressive morphological filter (PMF)}{


This method is an implementation of the Zhang et al. (2003) algorithm (see reference).
This is not a strict implementation of Zhang et al. This algorithm works at the raw point
cloud level without any rasterization process. The morphological operator is applied on
the points cloud not on a raster. Therefore some parameters from the original
description are no longer useful. The cell size \code{c} (equation 7) is not a requiered
parameter. Therefore in the original paper the threshold sequence was (equation 7):\cr\cr
\eqn{th_k = s*(w_k - w_{k-1})*c + th_0}\cr\cr
Now it is:\cr\cr
\eqn{th_k = s*(w_k - w_{k-1}) + th_0}\cr\cr
This method support an extra logical parameters \code{exponential} to change the method
used to create the windows size sequence. Default is FALSE. See reference.
